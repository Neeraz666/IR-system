Climate change displacing Indigenous people across the world

Climate change-induced displacement of Indigenous communities is a multifaceted challenge. Apart from the evident environmental threats, forced relocations also result in the erosion of traditional governance, cultural practices and religious beliefs. This disruption often leads to mental health struggles, including depression, anxiety and, tragically, suicide.

Amidst these challenges, the scope of their impact is staggering. Indigenous people and rural communities inhabit more than 50% of the world's land, spanning all continents except Antarctica.

Within this vast expanse, 40% of the land traditionally occupied by Indigenous peoples is located in areas of high biodiversity, showcasing their pivotal role as custodians of precious ecosystems.

However, this custodianship comes at a cost, as Indigenous communities face poverty rates two to three times higher than the global average, underscoring the intersection of environmental vulnerability and economic marginalization.

In a disheartening statistic, climate change is displacing Indigenous communities at seven times the rate of the global population, leaving ancestral lands slipping away and traditions hanging in the balance.

These numbers speak to the urgency of understanding and addressing the unique challenges faced by Indigenous communities in the face of an evolving climate landscape.

As we navigate the unique challenges faced by Indigenous communities in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Cameroon and neighboring areas of the Central African Republic, it is essential to recognize that these are not isolated incidents but part of a broader global pattern.

Climate challenges facing Indigenous communities
Here are some examples of climate challenges facing Indigenous communities across the world:

The Kalash community (Pakistan): Guardians of the Hindu Kush now confronting melting glaciers
In the Chitral district of Pakistan, approximately 5,000 people belonging to the Kalash community are grappling with the profound impacts of accelerated climate change. Among the 3,044 glacial lakes in northern Pakistan, 33 are deemed to be at high risk of bursting, amplifying the threat of glacial floods that have reshaped entire landscapes.

These floods pose serious risks, including soil erosion, species displacement and food insecurity. The Kalash community, with a longstanding history in the region, now confronts an existential crisis, contemplating the necessity of relocation amidst mounting environmental challenges.

The Munda community (Bangladesh): Coastal dwellers thrust into urban slums
By 2050, an estimated 50 million people in Bangladesh are expected to be displaced due to the impacts of climate change, with those in coastal zones facing the highest vulnerability.

Within the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, the Munda community has resided for two centuries, yet they remain disadvantaged due to their minority status, lacking access to microfinance, benefits and employment opportunities available to others.

Razu Bala Munda, a 75-year-old widow from the Munda community, is entitled to a widow allowance of BDT500 ($6) per month and an old age allowance of BDT800 ($9), but she receives neither, highlighting systemic disparities and neglect within the community.

The Mbororo community (Cameroon & Central African Republic): Discrimination aggravated by climate-induced disasters
The Mbororo community, an Indigenous group situated in the borderlands of Cameroon and neighbouring areas of the Central African Republic, has endured long-standing discrimination and abuses.

The exacerbation of their plight comes with climate-induced disasters like droughts and heatwaves, intensifying their challenges. Over the past two decades, thousands of deaths have been attributed to farmer-herder skirmishes, highlighting the nexus between climate change, political crises and the resulting loss of biodiversity.

Security and economic challenges interact with climate-induced disasters, as prolonged droughts often exacerbate tensions among different groups of people. Conflicts between nomadic Mbororo herders and farmers, along with incidents of cattle rustling, are stark realities in non-demarcated protected areas and national parks.

The Indigenous Mbororo herders face these challenges daily, with climate change compounding their plight. In 2023, Africa experienced a devastating toll from extreme weather disasters, with at least 15,700 lives lost.

Tragically, a significant portion of these casualties were from the Mbororo community, highlighting the acute vulnerability of these individuals to climate-induced disasters.

Why Indigenous knowledge must be at the heart of climate policy-making
As the global community grapples with the escalating impacts of climate change, it is clear we need sustainable solutions rooted in the wisdom of those who have nurtured and protected the Earth for generations.

Placing Indigenous knowledge at the heart of climate policy-making is not just a matter of equity; it is a strategic imperative. Indigenous communities bring a wealth of traditional practices, adaptive strategies, and a profound understanding of their ecosystems. This knowledge, shaped over centuries, can guide policies that are not only effective but also respectful of diverse ways of life.

However, to truly harness the potential of Indigenous knowledge, it is crucial to address existing gaps. Improved data collection mechanisms are needed to fully understand the nuanced impacts of climate induced displacement on Indigenous people.

Equally important is the need to actively listen and learn from those directly affected, ensuring their voices shape the policies intended to support them.

In countries where ancestral lands lack official recognition, the challenges are exacerbated. Without recognized properties, Indigenous communities face increased vulnerability, and the threat of land grabbing for economic exploitation looms large.
